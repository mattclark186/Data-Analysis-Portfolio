# Data Analysis Portfolio
This is my portfolio of data analysis projects I've done. They involve obtaining data, data cleaning and data visualisation using tools such as Python, SQL and Tableau.


# 1 - Football Wages
Python, SQL, Tableau

**Goal:** To investigate whether the best football (soccer) players get paid the most money. 

**Description:** The dataset was scraped from a website using Python. It contained information about different football teams from different European countries over the previous 10 seasons - specifically how much they paid their players and how well the teams performed. The data was then cleaned in MySQL and manipulated into useful tables. The tables were imported into Tableau to be visualised. 

**Conclusion:** It's clear that paying players higher wages generally results in a better performance overall. Across the different countries, the teams paying the highest wages have had different levels of success. In no country has it been the case that the highest payers have always been the most successfull, this being further from the case in some countries than in others.
